FlowNet: Learning Optical Flow with Convolutional Networks

This project implements the paper "FlowNet: Learning Optical Flow with Convolutional Networks" in Keras using the flyingchairsSD dataset. Optical flow is a computer vision technique that estimates the motion of objects in a video sequence. This project aims to reproduce the results of the paper by training and evaluating a neural network for optical flow estimation.



Results

Funnily enough since i trained this on my GTX980M the network never really converged fully, but surprisingly produced an unintended effect of removing background from the video frames and keeping track of all fast moving objects showing their flow. Inadvertly became a tracker for fast moving objects !!! 
So is it paper worthy ? i dont know and i am too lazy to write long paras praising my findings.
