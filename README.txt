1) In-order for you to run the code on any image-pair/video you'll have to first put the video/image-pair in the same
   folder as the file "flow_predict" 

2) open "flow_predict" go down to the bottom of the code and use any of the two functions mentioning the path name
of the image-pair/video into the function to get results .

3) if you want to run the training again you'll hvae to download the charisSDHom dataset and run "keras_flownet_model"

4) please dont touch rest of the files since they're interdependent and any changes might break the code entirely

5) Vids folder contains the normal youtube videos and its predicted video from our network.
